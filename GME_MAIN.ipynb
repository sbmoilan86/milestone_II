I’m gonna buy me a nice car and live the life I already live, except with the traveling and little things here and there that I’ll buy for myself. And when I have kids I’m gonna send them to the same public school I went to. Y? It’s simple. I want my kids to grow up with the mindset of a warrior. I want them to walk to school with their friends, to crack jokes and roast each other in the cafeteria. I want my kids to look forward to pizza Friday, and those class parties the teachers would throw. I want them to get hyped at the pep rally’s, to get into a fight or back up their friend during a fight after school, I want them to get a bad grade in a class because the teachers an asshole, to skip school to go see their bf/gf, to get a part time as a junior/senior so they can learn responsibilities and save enough money for their prom as well as their last trip with their friends, I want them To apply for scholarships and to work hard in the summer.

      " One part of his post really stood out to me. He said to make a list of the things you want to do with your money. It really made me sit down and think about why I put all of my extra cash in GME... I have spent a significant portion of my life in financial scarcity. I am a pediatric nurse, I love my patients and I love my job. I pay more to live close to my job because where I want to live (my hometown) is a 45 minute commute to and from work and after working a 13 hour shift it’s just too hard to drive that far. I always joke about buying a Tesla so one day I can live in my hometown close to my family and friends and let my car drive me to and from work - I just wanna keep working my dream job and live close to home. Not too much to ask, right? When I sat down and made my list it made me realize that my highest priorities with this money is to pay it forward. \n",

Once again it seems like we are getting hammered over the weekend, though now the efforts seem to be more complicated then just trying to paper-hand people. While I have no scholastic credentials that makes me any more of an expert then you all, I have paid witness to countless manipulative behaviors over the course of the past four years thanks to the turbulent Trump presidency and recent election. There are a lot of similarities in the way things were pushed then and the way things are being pushed now. So I figured I would outline some of the things that I've picked up on over the years so you can improve your critical thinking and approach these bots/shills/trolls from a point of strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\*PLEASE NOTE, this post is not and will not be political. I simply mentioned the whole Trump thing to show that this manipulative behavior is not new on reddit. This GME situation is not and has never been political, and I completely respect that members of both political parties have come out in support of us retail investors during this whole situation.\\*\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT 1: Also a quick note. Please understand that we very well could have manipulation on both sides of the narrative. Don't allow yourself to assume the people posting stuff you want to hear are acting in good faith. Be ever vigilant, because while we want to make sure we are calling out FUD, we don't want this sub to become a prohibitive echo chamber. Always approach situations with logic first, get emotional about things after.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT 2: Just another quick note since I forgot to mention it before. Reddit is great because it allows for user moderation in place of direct mod action. While I admire and respect the job that the current mods are doing, remember they are only human. You have a lot of power in dealing with these malicious actors yourself just by downvoting. Don't leave everything to the mods because in the time it takes to get the post taken down and/or the user banned there could have been multiple people that have seen the problem post; And that allows shit to spread.\n",

      "* **Look for Obvious Appeals to Emotion.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an easy one to start out with. The GME situation right now is built upon a solid foundation of data and information that has been collected, shared, and scrutinized by multiple parties. For a lot of these malicious actors, the intent is to move the focus away from those strong foundations to get you thinking emotionally. Thinking emotionally inhibits your ability to see things logically and can help create doubt on things that you would otherwise be very confident about. Gaslighting is an example of this sort of play, its meant to get you second guessing the things that you were so sure about before. Because if you start second guessing your confidence in the data, you have a higher chance of second guessing the people giving that data which breeds uncertainy and distrust. What the ultimate goal of these comments is, I'm not sure. I'm sure a lot of it is to try and get people to sell, but in my opinion I think there is this deliberate effort to try and paint us all as uncaring people.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these, I recommend everyone to downvote them if it appears that they are injecting emotion into a thread or situation that didn't really call for it. Examples of this include:\n",

      "\\- \"People are out here betting their life savings, won't you think of those poor souls?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "If you think the commenter is acting in good faith or make good points, by all means engage with them. But make sure to keep yourself centered and don't allow yourself to get baited into saying something that they want you to say.\n",

For someone who uses reddit a lot, its easy to get into this idea that your comment threads and discussions are just between you and the person you are talking with. And you would be right, assuming you were dealing with someone who was acting in good faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oftentimes bots/shills/trolls are not acting in good faith and so they are not really seeing it in the same way as you. For these individuals (Or robots I guess if its a bot), the intent is not to discuss/debate things but to push a message. In a public forum like reddit, everyone's comments and replies are available to see. So a lot of these malicious actors have taken to using that to their advantage by speaking through people in order to push a certain narrative or paint communities in certain ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, lets say you see a new post with a title saying something obviously wrong like \"Shorts have covered, games over\". Thats obviously wrong, and you're pissed at them for pushing something so incorrect. So you go into the thread and call them out, which they then respond to your comment basically doubling down and not changing their stance. You can bring up data or examples, but they will always push back, moving the goalposts or pointing to something unrelated. If this sounds familiar to you, its because it is a super common strategy of shills and trolls. They aren't really engaging with you, they are trying to influence the person reading the thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its hard to really grasp sometimes, but for all those that are commenting and engaging in the sub, there are countless number of people that are just lurking and scrolling through all the posts and comments. The name of the game is to try and influence those people, rather then try to convince you that your position is wrong (Bots/shills/trolls can't prove your position is wrong because most of the time they are arguing an intentionally stupid point). You see this all the time in this sub, but here are some examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Anytime you see someone pushing a certain phrase or number they are most likely trying to influence lurkers. Stuff like the double-down Monday FUD that was being spread earlier are meant to forcefully thrust something into the public discourse. You can see how the more they were called out on it, the more we saw them change their strategy to continue to push it. Now the thing is to make threads with titles like \"I know Double Down Monday isn't a thing, but...\" or \"Double Down isn't coordination\".  See how even though they present themselves as rational actors, they are taking the time and effort to continue to make the event a thing. Because they aren't focused on convincing us regular users, they are wanting to show people lurking or visiting the sub that we are doing illegal shit. **When we aren't.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dealing with these can be tricky because you are giving them more chances to push their shit by calling them out in a reply. The best thing to do is to downvote and report, but I would recommend going one step further. If they are going to just talk behind us, then I see no reason why we can't do the same thing. So if I see a comment or thread that I know is someone acting in bad faith, I'll reply to their comment but phrase my comment so that I'm talking to anyone reading the thread. If people aren't going to act in good faith, there is no reason to engage with them directly.\n",

      "This is another big one that I wanted to point out because I saw a metric fuck-ton of it during the hearing. When someone is looking to manipulate people, they need to first connect with the people they are manipulating in some way. Finding common ground is a good way of making friends, so why wouldn't it also be a good way of manipulating people?\n",
      "\n",
      "Be wary of people that push certain messages or feelings as \"just saying what everyone else is thinking\". Don't allow your critical thinking to slip because it looks like they are voicing something that a bunch of other people agree with. Oftentimes, the sentiment that they are using is right but being used in the wrong way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure we all saw the flood of comments and threads during the hearing calling out the House members. As someone that came of age in the 2000's, I'm well aware of the general sentiment that \"Government can't do anything\" or \"They aren't here to help us, its all for show\". And as I was saying before, those grievances are warranted as the government has let us down in the past. But you have to recognize that you are allowing malicious actors to prime your response to something before that thing has actually happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "For anyone who actually watched the hearing, the vast majority of the house members were supportive of retail traders and were grilling RH and Melvin. And while it was frustrating that they seemed to ask the wrong questions, or get to questions late, understand that they have not been following this as closely as the rest of us. They most likely didn't have all the info from the get-go and are probably gearing up their questions for the second hearing so that they are more pertinent. You coming to a conclusion that they are all crooks so prematurely just gives these malicious actors what they want.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these, I recommend downvoting and moving on. You can call them out, but just know that doing so is tricky because the nature of the discussion allows them to easily pivot into politics. I've seen it happen multiple times, politics is an easy way to divide people. Just remember that this is a GME thing, it was never a political thing. We are here because we like the stock, we understand the squeeze, and we want to see Gamestop succeed.

      " I joined GME in January like most of us after WSB's overnight coup and crypto scam surfaced while being infiltrated with unmoderated shills. I had a lot of time on my hands back then before the baby was born - I was hunting down & reading every single piece of DD related to GME, but everything I read was going out the window when shill waves pushed FUD. I never sold but noticed how panic creeps in and I forget all that knowledge. So I started collecting everything that I read to not forget what I learned when FUD kicks in and balance the pros vs the cons during panic. It made a huge difference to my morale on bad days, to the point that I could easily manage to clear the minds of those that were falling for FUD and panicking.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of weeks in, I decided to publish my collection, so I set up the DD list post on rGME and volunteered to moderate through modmail. I was accepted and was absolutely ecstatic to be on the frontline banning HF footsoldiers (plants), shill recruiters, spammers, scammers, harassers, and just straight-up assholes that wanted to trick others. It was enjoyable, not that much of a handful back then, and very very satisfying work. I don’t know if you can understand what it means to protect tens of thousands of users from the shadows, and I’m sure it’s not for everyone, but I felt truly proud of myself for making a difference to the little guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, over the next period of weeks the sub started to change into something very concerning: huge influx of shill accounts, scamming predators luring people through charity groups & spreading FUD about the sub to push users to join their groups, tons of alt accounts (not shills) ready to push a narrative through up/down voting and spamming slightly different comments with the same mentalities meant to convince users that everyone around them is thinking the same thing when it's actually just a handful of assholes with thousands of accounts, OG mods became inactive, and clashes between now ex-mods which leaked out. I'm relieved that so many of you noticed these things for yourselves and shared the info around to others for awareness’s sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took a lot of work to combat these growing concerns, and slowly the sub started shifting into something that I'm now not comfortable being a part of. I initially got into this to make sure misinformation doesn't spread and that good DD is vetted, but responsibilities dealing with the rest of these concerns started taking over priority, and it became too much very fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of the last 50 days, along with the insane amount of weight a stay-at-home dad with a fresh newborn has to bear, my willpower was draining, I started losing my temper, I stopped tending to IRL relationships, and put myself in a vicious cycle of self-destruction. In short: I got burned out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following recent events the OG mods decided to finally step in. After they decided to not stay in the loop even though all mods and now ex-mods tried to rope them in continuously through group chats, they were clearly uninformed of the whole situation and put out statements which make it seem like they have a handle of things, when we know they didn’t.  They made changes to the sub which showed that they do not. They reverted keyword-removals that puts the sub in jeopardy such as the r- word, and keywords relating to scams happening right now all across stock subreddits (such as 'decentralized WBS' that surfaced during the Jan coup), and basically reverted the weeks of sweaty work we all put in to protect you guys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, one OG mod admitted that they have been in contact with some known suspicious users and have been receiving suggestions on how to operate the sub, and then executing those suggestions. At this point we're unsure if those actions are intentional or innocent, but with other recent events, I personally feel it's in my best interests to cut ties for my own sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I’ve made my decision. I'm done swimming against the current and getting nowhere fighting internally only to end up not being able to protect users. I am unhappy with how this sub and other related subs are changing into something which puts retail investors in very vulnerable positions, as we saw what happened with the SEC comments and many other reasons that could potentially lead to these very same subs get investigated for retail investor collusion. Meanwhile, my IRL responsibilities need tending to which takes much of my energy and leaves me drained from being able to keep argumenting in-house to do what is right to the point that I end up wasting the little energy left in me and end up doing barely any needed work. I believe that people with fewer responsibilities than me and more time on their hands can do a better job and I leave it to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOWEVER, I am not done fighting against misinformation. I will continue to urge you to read, question, and review everything that **anyone** posts on reddit. I will continue to remind you to make the effort to not fall onto any conclusions before you doubt everything you ever read on any sub. To DD, discuss & cross-review all information yourselves, no matter how trusted you believe the poster to be. There are people here with agendas, who may seem sweet and helpful on the outside, but are sharks on the inside waiting for the right moment to screw you over. However, I will not continue to do any of that on rGME, as I no longer want to be associated with it or any other existing sub related to it which is the home of these very same crooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have decided to open a new sub dedicated to the provision and discussion of **truthful** information related to GameStop stock ($GME) with one cause:\n",
      "\n",
      "To protect all shareholders of GME through education & research meant to put a spotlight on the truth while exposing criminal activity: market manipulation, pump & dump schemes, scams, collusion, FUD, and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "I primarily browsed rGME for quality DD and I realized that many people did the same thing and wanted a space free from anything else. It just made sense to separate entertainment from information, and this is what encouraged me to put in the work and set it all up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of being a jack of all trades sub like the rest, our focus is information and discussion. No memes, shitposts, or entertainment posts will be allowed to flood the feed & encourage users to turn their brain off before they scroll to a deep dive post, at which point not having the will to read a page of text and just say \"*meh, fuck it, I’ll just let other users guide me about what to do and believe when info get popular and floods the feed*.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So to combat misinformation and criminal activity the sub is set to post-restricted. What this means is that the public can comment freely, but **submitting a post requires pre-approval by a team of DD reviewers before it is made public.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is to ensure that no published post contains misinformation or unstated speculation so that readers can easily distinguish between hard-fact and theory/opinion. This also makes it easy for mods to identify criminal activity such as market manipulating FUD & scams, thereby safeguarding readers from being tricked with bullshit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DD Vets remain unbiased about the content of any submission during review. We merely ask for evidence to back statements, opinions, and speculation - and when unavailable we ask the author to state the information for what it is. It is clear that the most valuable DD challenges existing viewpoints with new evidence, and the last thing we want is to turn into an echo chamber of confirmation bias.\n",

He immediately begins jumping up and down, and starts enthusiastically shouting at you as you timidly scan the vehicles on display. You're taken aback, and feel a sudden sense of apprehension. By now, the salesperson is in your face. He grabs your hand and gives you an aggressive handshake. He asks you what you're in the market for, and you mention a couple of makes/models, including one from a rival manufacturer. This sets the salesperson off, and he starts ranting and raving like a lunatic, listing off all of his perceived arguments as to why you're an idiot for even considering that vehicle. You eventually reach a point where the energy and vibe are too much to handle, so you decide to leave and check out other dealerships. As you walk away, you feel relieved and mentally commit to never returning. \n",

You converse for a while, and he does a great job of answering your questions and calming your concerns. He shows you around, takes you on a few test drives, and before you know it, you're driving down the highway in your new vehicle with a big smile on your face. The experience with dealership 'B' was fantastic. Not only did you buy the vehicle, but you felt confident in your decision to do so.

Mods shouldn't have to babysit this sub all day just to delete numerous posts to ensure relevant/helpful posts attain visibility.

A guideline of some sort if you will. \n",

I'm sure I don't have to tell you about all the crazy distraction stock stuff that has been spread today. Notice how a VAST majority of the posts discussing this stock are actually calling it out. This is part of their new approach, to go with the grain rather then against it and just sprinkle little bits of FUD here and there in order to gain control of the narrative.\n",
      "      * Let's break down an example. Say for instance you see a post titled something like \"I got banned cause I called out WSB shills on their RKT pumping\". From a glance there isn't anything here that would invoke suspicion, after all we all know WSB is compromised and banning people. And we know that people have been pushing that distraction stock the entire day. However, you have to take a step back and approach it from a different perspective.\n",
      "      * Ask yourself this, if someone genuinely wanted to point out that rocket was obviously a distraction stock what would they do? Would they make another post in new about it after seeing the plethora of other posts already talking about it? Would they include the ticker for the very stock that is being used as a distraction in the title?  The answer is no, because ultimately these things all help rather then hurt the spreading of this new FUD. A distraction is successful when it gets you focusing on something other then what you were focusing on in the first place. If that is the case, if someone was REALLY concerned about this distraction stock, would they actively continue to talk about it and thus continue the distraction?\n",
      "      * We're going to have to start approaching posts in new with a lot more scrutiny. Look past the words being written and try to think about the message those words are sending. And know that we are not dealing with people acting in good faith. Nothing has changed with regards to the nature of the squeeze or GME. Be cautious of those that would suggest otherwise, approach their posts thinking about how they are trying to change your mind. If they are trying to change your mind by actually discussion holes in DD and basing their information on actual data then allow yourself to take their argument into consideration.

I've seen numerous, obvious shills that will use this argument as a means of establishing some sort of credibility to their ridiculous argument. These are actually really easy to deal with, and there are multiple ways to handle jokers like these.\n",
      "      * Remember to simply posts on the basis of what is being writing rather then the person writing it. If someone asks you to go through their post history to prove that their position is not coming from bad faith, it is likely because they are acting in bad faith. When someone gets called out for being a shill, if that person wasn't a shill the easiest way to respond would be to simply bring actual data or evidence to support their argument. If instead they talk past your argument and try to get you to go through their post it just shows further that they have no intention of refuting anything.\n",
      "      * Another thing to keep in mind is that post histories are easily curated and manipulated. If you are a frequent browser of new like myself, I'm sure you've seen the numerous memes and shitposts that get posted throughout the day. Think back to some of the lower effort ones you've seen, ones that really stood out like the poster had spent maybe 5 minutes on it. All of those low effort posts could easily be shills building up a history on the sub so that they can then turn around and use their post history as a way of giving their narratives credibility.

Things like censoring half of the words under the sun, rules that make it easier to mod by 5% but increases the pain for users by 50%. That's not fair. I let many of those things happen because I didn't know any better. I only had two choices, voice my disapproval, or remove the mod. The former didn't result in anything, and the latter would have been overkill (with my knowledge at the time. In hindsight it would have been the right thing to do). But it just kept coming. It went from 1 false ban a day to 10. There were times where someone was banned every few minutes. That is not normal for even the most popular subreddits, let alone a medium-sized one like us.\n",

      "I'm not going to lie and say that GME is my biggest passion. Like everyone else, I have responsibilities and other hobbies and given finite time, I can only do so much on Reddit. The same goes for the few mods I trust. We don't have the connections or resources to have grand AMAs, advanced automation (ie. GME Bot), and the like. For the immediate future, please expect r/GME to be spartan. Superstonk is there for the fanfare, the lights and action. I wish for r/GME to be...plain. Simple. Familiar. Some of you remember how it was before the first squeeze. Yes, there was WSB emojis, lots of name-calling and the like, but it was simple and straightforward. There was no risk of being banned for mentioning a name. As the users grew, the risk of spam and shills wasn't really there. It was a fabricated fear that I knew better than to believe, but some people took it to heart. More rules started piling on. When you get people to fear something, that's a powerful tool. There have been some accusations that the ex-mods were only in it for themselves. That is not true. They love doing it and love their audience, but make mistakes like all of us. Just as Youtubers and streamers aren't discouraged from soliciting donations, these public figures shouldn't be either. I only have a problem with the fact that having moderators also be the prominent posters in the subreddit is a huge conflict of interest. I'll let you make your own conclusions on the morality of that. Being a moderator is not some kind of reward or crown. It's like being a gardener: mostly peaceful, selfless work, but you get to see the fruits of your garden. Yeah, you deal with manure sometimes, but it's worth it.\n",

And the same passion. To many people, they will always have more to offer than us going forward. I'm fine with that. Some people would rather r/GME get completely deleted. Whatever you want, please don't let it ruin other peoples' experiences. Some of you want thoroughly vetted DD here. I don't think that's realistic. But by Jove, we'll try.

I'm not the wrinkliest ape but it seems like everyday I read new DD that uncovers more and more fuckery, and the corruption runs deeper and deeper. To me it is perfectly conceivable that the corruption runs so deep that if the MOASS happened, several systems that prop the U.S. up as a global superpower would fail; the economy has significant impact on almost every other aspect of a civilization. I cannot forsee exactly how this would happen because this is way outside my area of expertise, which is why I want to start a discussion about this. In the case of such a black swan event in which so much collapses, why wouldn't the government intervene?\n",

MSM would paint apes as the bad guys as usual, and while a number of people would try and tell the world about the fuckery that just happened, I could see most of it being swept under the rug by MSM + government and things would go on as normal. Most people are busy outside the market; they have jobs and families etc. Would they read up on the fuckery and throw up arms and leave the market, or would they just say \"Yup, government's corrupt, what's new?\" and continue on in the market as normal? Other nations would be caught in a prisoner's dilemma where if one nation decided to withdraw from the U.S. market, the rest of the other nations would continue to prosper.

      " Hi everyone, after today's action in both GME and AMC I thought it would be good for everyone to see how much ammunition the shorts have to continue to attack, so I gathered the shortable stock availability data from Interactive Brokers. I can't speak to the accuracy of these numbers (perhaps others can chime in) but if accurate, they let us know if a short attack might be imminent, or perhaps when the MOASS is near. When there are no shares left to short, the shorts lose a valuable tool to manipulate the stock.\n",

In a nutshell, every single dollar represented by a new FTD corresponds to a permanent [rise in the average low of the stock price 35 days later](https://i.imgur.com/dymmbEx.png). This can be determined by comparing each day's nominal FTD $ value to the prior day and summing up any increase in value between each day.

      "Two models were needed for price action before and after the January squeeze since the pre-Jan model overestimates the price during and after the March run-up. Neither model predicts the January run up well but other than that, the price follows the models closely. Both equations spike during the March run up and cross on T+35 date 3-1-21 and are joined there to create the floor. Subtracting one standard deviation of around 0.084 creates a floor that the price rarely falls under. Whenever it has, it only did for a week at most before spiking and never falling below that level again. Subtracting two deviations creates a floor that is only ever touched on one day in September 2020. The current -1 deviation level will hit $200 on 7-18-21 and is currently $185 on 7-6-21. The current average price is $223 on 7-6-21 and will be $237 on 7-18-21. Every $52 million in total new FTDS has corresponded to a 10% average price increase with this model since the March run up.\n",

I started digging into the settlement dates and how they sometimes caused massive price spikes with large numbers of FTDs and came up with this. Unlike the exponential trendline where the price is simply following an exponential increase over time, this model tries to explain price movement by the total value of all new FTDs over time. This model has followed the recent price action much closer than the exponential trendline. I'm not sure why the running total value of FTDs reflects in the price so strongly but this model assumes that there is a permanent increase in price with every dollar of new FTD even after it is \"delivered\".\n",

When the short squeeze happens, many of the short-seller would go bankrupt and be forced to liquidate most of their asset. They would try everything they could to drive down the price from doubling down short, MSM FUD, or other ways. \n",

      "We definitely know that the short squeeze did not happen at the current price level. What could cause someone to dump the price? It is improbable the massive dip was driven from the long side of profit-taking.  Because such a massive dip must from the institutional level, and most of the institutional profit-taking has happened in the first round. And in the second run-up,  people have a higher entry price point and better understand how the short squeeze should play out. With the higher entry point and higher expectation price, the long side investors are less likely to sell their whole position at the current price for profit-taking. So, It must come from someone who wants to drive down the price for their best interest. Yes, the short seller. \n",

      "Because at this point, there is no exit strategy for the short-seller to exit safely. They are truly at either profit or bankrupt. If they decide to double down short positions and people sell off. They would end up a nice profit from GME. Even if a short squeeze happened, they are no worse than covering their position rn. Therefore, doubling down would be their only option at this time. And they had changed their way of shorting the stock instead of keeping the price steady downward. They are letting the price climb and patiently borrowing or even buying some of the shares to dump at once. They know that people would not sell off their shares unless they were convinced that the short squeeze had happened and people are dumping the stock.  So they wait for the price to break into 350 and dump the price lower and lower to fake like the short squeeze happened last week.\n",

If their tactics do not convince people, they will go bankrupt, the same as they are covering their short position now.

      "\n",
      "First: what I understand. The price at any given moment is found by balancing an order book of bids and asks- you can see this order book on most major trading software. On one side, you can see how much people are willing to sell their shares for. On the other, how much people are willing to buy them for. When there's more buying volume, the price goes up, since you have to find someone willing to sell, so you have to go into more expensive sell prices.\n",

      "What I assume: There are fancy algorithms behind the scenes following the price as big corporations continuously add limit buys and sells to help 'run' the market beyond us retail monkeys just putting in market orders.\n",

      "What I'm curious about: What happens if, say, a market buy order is dropped on the market that exceeds the volume of every sell order on the books?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is, after all, what everyone is talking about with a squeeze; a margin call causing a market buy order bigger than the whole float, possibly by 2-10x. Definitely bigger than the order book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd guess there would still be volume because someone, especially larger firms with more shares, would sell steadily on the way up. But it's strange to imagine the buy order being entered and just... Not filled, because there's not anyone selling. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, imagine some kind of manipulation like this: brokers cap selling price at $500, and apes, offended and horrified, just... Don't sell. And so there's just a market buy order sitting there, for millions of shares, unfulfilled. Theoretically the price is infinity, but practically it's $500. How does the market handle something like that?\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole thing just fascinates me. I probably have a misconception about how a margin call works for big bois but I'm curious about the mechanics of the squeeze itself.

      "* NSCC’s liquidity risk management has evolved in order to adhere to regulatory requirements that were adopted after Rule 4(A) was implemented.As part of its efforts to maintain compliance with these requirements, NSCC has continued to strengthen its liquidity risk management strategy, including through growing and diversifying its qualifying liquid resources. In connection with these ongoing efforts, **NSCC is proposing to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD every Business Day rather than only in connection with Options Expiration Activity Periods**. This proposed change would improve **NSCC’s ability to measure and monitor its daily liquidity exposures and allow it to collect additional qualifying liquid resources from Members whose activity poses the largest liquidity exposure to NSCC in connection with their daily settlement activity, and not only during Options Expiration Activity Periods**. By measuring SLD against Members’ actual daily settlement activity and NSCC’s available qualifying liquid resources, the proposal would also help mitigate risks to NSCC that it is unable to secure adequate default liquidity from other sources in an amount necessary to meet its liquidity needs. **For example, the proposal would help mitigate the risks that could arise if investor demand for the short-term notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program weakens, there is limited investor demand for term debt issued pursuant to a Term Debt Issuance, or NSCC is unable to renew its Line of Credit at the targeted amount.**\n",
      "* (iii) Amended Rule 4(A) and Proposed Daily Calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits In order to better address the liquidity risks presented by Members’ daily activity, **NSCC is proposing to amend Rule 4(A) to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD every Business Day rather than only in connection with the monthly expiration of stock options.**\n",
      "* In order to implement this proposed change to the timing of the SLD, NSCC would make a number of changes to Rule 4(A), described below. The **proposed changes to Rule 4(A) would implement a daily calculation and collection of SLD, simplify and clarify the calculations done in connection with the SLD requirements, and enhance the disclosures of the SLD requirements**.\n",

      "Proposed Daily Calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits: \n",
      "\n",
      "* Supplemental Liquidity Providers.\n",
      "   * The proposed approach would no longer require a calculation using NSCC’s available liquid resources on each day in the Lookback Period but would use a simpler approach by looking only at liquidity need\n",
      "* Supplemental Liquidity Obligation\n",
      "   * After NSCC determines the Supplemental Liquidity Providers, NSCC would then determine if any of the Supplemental Liquidity Providers would be required to pay an SLD on that Business Day. The proposed Rule 4(A) would use a simplified calculation by determining if ***the Daily Liquidity Need for each Supplemental Liquidity Provider on that Business Day exceeds the sum of NSCC’s qualifying liquid resources available to NSCC on that day, assuming stressed market conditions*** (described below)\n",
      "   * Because this calculation would be done at the start of each Business Day (as discussed further below), it would be based on the Qualifying Liquid Resources, including Required Fund Deposits to the Clearing Fund, available to NSCC as of the end of the prior Business Day. Additionally, in order to anticipate market conditions that could cause Qualifying Liquid Resources to be unavailable on that day, NSCC would apply stress scenarios in determining its total Qualifying Liquid Resources for purposes of Rule 4(A). \n",
      "   * The proposed change would allow NSCC to **continue to assume stressed markets in its SLD calculations,** ***which protects it against unexpected market events***\n",
      "   * Instead, the Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of a Member would be calculated based on the **actual liquidity exposure that its daily activity would pose to NSCC on that particular day in the event of that Member’s default.**\n",
      "   * Each Supplemental Liquidity Provider that has a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation on a Business Day would receive a notice from NSCC of the amount of its Supplemental Liquidity Obligation and would be required to make a deposit in that amount to the Clearing Fund **within one hour of such notice.** The proposed timing of funding a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation would mirror the current requirement that is applied to Members’ Required Fund Deposits, which is also calculated and collected daily, and **must be funded within one hour of demand**. Specifically, NSCC expects to deliver notification of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations to Supplemental Liquidity Providers **by around 8:30 AM ET each Business Day, with deposits required by no later than 9:30 AM ET. (hedgies getting margin called???)** \n",
      "* Proposed Pro Rata Calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations\n",
      "   * In such circumstances, **when multiple Members have relatively large Supplemental Liquidity Obligations of more than $2 billion**, NSCC would have the option to determine if it is appropriate to collect the largest SLD calculated for that Business Day, divided pro rata among the Supplemental Liquidity Providers rather than collect the each of the Supplemental Liquidity Obligations of those firms.\n",
      "* Returns of SLD and Miscellaneous Matters\n",
      "   * NSCC may hold SLD for up to seven Business Days after the end of the applicable Options Expiration Activity Period and may hold SLD funded pursuant to a Special Activity Liquidity Call for up to 90 days after such deposit is made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proposed Changes to Rule 4(A)\n",
      "\n",
      "* However, the proposed changes would simplify this section by removing a statement **that specifically identifies two of NSCC’s principal sources of liquidity and would instead more generally refer to NSCC’s sources of liquidity**. The proposed changes to Section 1 of Rule 4(A) would also remove references to options expiration activity periods, which would no longer be applicable to the SLD requirement under this proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. First, Section 2 of proposed Rule 4(A) would remove the definition of “Special Activity Calculation Date,” which is tied to the monthly Options Expiration Activity Period, and **instead would use the term “Business Day” throughout proposed Rule 4(A), where appropriate. Business Day is currently defined in Rule 1 as any day on which NSCC is open for business.**\n",
      "2. Second, Section 2 of the proposed Rule 4(A) revise other defined terms that use the phrase “Special Activity” to either remove that phrase or, when appropriate, to replace this phrase with the term “Supplemental.\n",
      "3. Third, the proposed changes to Section 2 of Rule 4(A) would include one defined term for “Qualifying Liquid Resources” to refer to all default liquidity resources available  to NSCC to settle its payment obligations as a central counterparty.  \n",

      " tl;dr This is an excerpt from an anti-corruption blog. It outlines historical regulatory capture, online shilling, fake news etc with regards to illegal naked short selling. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Illegal naked shorting involves hedge funds and their brokers selling stock that they have not located, borrowed or purchased. They are selling phantom stock. Data from the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that more than two billion of these phantom shares were circulating on most days during the year leading up to the market crash in September, 2008. Many experts agree the data is incomplete, and that the real number is many times larger. Phantom stock distorts supply and wipes billions of dollars of value from our markets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Meanwhile, unscrupulous short-sellers and affiliated investors use a variety of other tactics to drive down stock prices and destroy public companies. They hire thugs to stalk and threaten corporate executives and their families. They pay small armies of “bashers” to flood the Internet with scurrilous rumors and lies. They engage in extortion and blackmail. And they collude with crooked law firms to saddle corporations with bogus class-action lawsuits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They also conspire to cut off companies’ access to credit. They finance dubious market indexes and credit rating agencies that spread false information about the prospects of companies and the economy. They pay shady financial research shops to publish false, negative information, disguised as “independent” analysis. And they manipulate credit default swaps and derivatives, the prices of which are considered indicators of corporate health.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For years, the government did nothing. Indeed, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies came to rely on short-sellers for incriminating information about public companies. Even when it became clear that much of this information was false or misleading, and had led to dead-end investigations that drained corporate resources and destroyed market value, officials maintained relationships with short-sellers and refrained from looking into their activities. Many of these officials were enticed by the prospect of leaving government for high-paying jobs at hedge funds and affiliated law firms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With the SEC co-opted, prime brokers and market makers lost incentive to obey the rules and instead enabled the crookery of their high-paying hedge fund clients. The stock exchanges — “self-regulatory organizations” — looked the other way in deference to the brokers who are their members. An outfit called the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which is supposed to ensure that stock is delivered, fails to do so because it is owned by the Wall Street brokerages that profit from selling stock that does not exist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Meanwhile, the DTCC, a black box organization if there ever was one, processes securities transactions valued at $1.5 quadrillion – or 30 times the gross product of the entire planet – every year, with little or no oversight from regulators or Congress.”\n",

      "“In the summer of 2008, the SEC finally acknowledged that illegal naked short selling was a problem. Indeed, it suggested that naked short selling had the potential to collapse the financial system, and in July 2008, it issued an “emergency order” that protected 19 of the nation’s biggest financial companies from the crime. Many wondered why the SEC couldn’t extend similar protection to the hundreds of other companies that were affected, but there was hope that the SEC had come to recognize the dangers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In August of 2008, however, the SEC lifted its “emergency order” and hedge funds immediately launched unprecedented naked short selling attacks on Lehman Brothers, American International Group, Merrill Lynch, Washington Mutual, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and many other financial institutions. Within three weeks, the naked short sellers had produced enough phantom stock – and planted enough false rumors and biased media reports – to help sink the stock prices of those big financial companies to single digits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Their suppressed stock prices made it impossible for the companies to raise new capital, and within days Lehman Brothers had gone bankrupt; AIG had been partially nationalized; Washington Mutual had been seized by U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision; Merrill Lynch (on the verge of bankruptcy) had been purchased by Bank of America; and Fannie and Freddie had been taken over by the government. Those companies were all weak before the short sellers attacked. There are many reasons why they found themselves in such dire trouble. But abusive short selling accelerated their demise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“After the near total collapse of the financial system, the SEC closed some loopholes that had helped hedge funds engage in naked short selling without getting caught. One of these loopholes – a rule that allowed market makers to temporarily sell stock they had not yet borrowed or purchased in order to “maintain liquidity” — had been written by Bernard Madoff, who was simultaneously orchestrating the biggest criminal Ponzi scheme in history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madoff had considerable influence at the SEC, so the SEC allowed Madoff to author its loophole. Then the SEC named the loophole after him. It was called “the Madoff Exemption.””\n",
      "\n",
      "“Although the SEC has closed some loopholes, there are other loopholes to exploit, and naked short selling continues. Unscrupulous short-sellers also continue to use their other dirty tricks to drive down stock prices. Bank of America and Citigroup have been brutally attacked in recent months, as have countless smaller companies – entrepreneurial companies with innovative products; biotech firms with medicines that could save lives. Many of these companies are struggling for their survival.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This scandal has provoked outrage among executives and thousands of ordinary people, many of whom have deluged Congress and the SEC with letters. In response, six Senators declared that naked short selling helped collapse the financial markets, and authored a bill calling on the SEC to enforce stricter rules.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Meanwhile, other prominent officials – including former Chairmen of the SEC, the Secretary of the Treasury, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, multiple U.S. Congressmen, the CEO’s of Wall Street’s biggest banks, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John McCain – have implicated naked short selling in the recent financial turmoil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the halls of Congress and the SEC swarm with hedge fund lobbyists, and the government remains behind the ball. Specifically, the lobbyists have so far successfully stymied efforts to have the SEC enforce a “pre-borrow” that would require hedge funds and brokers to obtain actual shares before selling them, in each and every case. Meanwhile, the SEC has yet to prosecute a single major hedge fund for illegal naked short selling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most disturbing of all, perhaps, is the fact that the mainstream media has utterly failed to cover what is surely the biggest financial scandal of our era. Not only have journalists failed to cover naked short selling crimes, but many have come to rely on miscreant hedge funds as sources of “dirt” for negative stories (many of them false or biased) about public companies that the hedge funds are attacking. Perhaps these relationships explain why journalists have hesitated to write critically about short sellers. Perhaps other incentives have entered into their calculations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Deep Capture has identified one clique of influential reporters – some merely dishonest, some giving all appearances of outright corruption, all with unusually close ties to one particular group of short-selling hedge fund managers. For years, these reporters churned out “hatchet jobs” that benefited the hedge funds financially, while going to great lengths to whitewash the crime of naked short-selling. When evidence of the crime began to appear on the Internet, hedge funds and some of these journalists hijacked social media, clogging message boards and even obtaining special editing privileges on Wikipedia, to distort the public discourse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many of those journalists have since faded from the scene. As the crime and the cover-up was exposed, some of them sought to distance themselves from short sellers. One day after “The Story of Deep Capture” exposed CNBC’s Jim Cramer as being a central figure in the cover-up, Cramer announced that naked short selling was a big problem. Soon after, he began calling some short sellers “diabolical,” and announced that he was on a “crusade” to stop illegal naked short selling from destroying America. Other reporters in Cramer’s circle have since left journalism and gone to work for the short sellers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Outside of this clique, most mainstream journalists are honest. There are segments of the mainstream media that do not rely on short sellers as their only sources of information. But for whatever reasons, even the uncompromised journalists have shied away from reporting on one of the most important issues affecting our economy”. \n",

In order to pay retail investors off (acting as the SEC) it would involve paying off 100s of thousands of not millions of people individually, which at that point would not be appealing to anyone to try and do.

      "I will also continue to work on illegal naked shorting. I truly believe that this is at the heart of one of the largest criminal enterprises on earth, the manipulation of security prices through collusion of Wall Street investment banks and hedge funds. There now or will soon exist the technology to stop this practice. As I have discussed in prior reports, Wall Street firms totally control trading and clearing of securities through DTCC and Its subsidiary CEDE. The DTCC is a private company owned by Wall Street firms and is at the heart of illegal naked shorting. All of this is done in total darkness. Blockchain technology can replace Wall Street’s iron grip on trading and clearing securities and it will. You can’t believe the power of this technology. I don’t claim to understand how it works but I have listened to enough brilliant people to intuit where it is going. Just as the internet has and continues to disrupt industry after industry, so will the blockchain disrupt Wall Street firms and many other entrenched, tired institutions like banks, other financial intermediaries, universities, ad infinitum. Wall Street firms have enormous financial and political power and will fiercely resist efforts to implement blockchain trading, but it will happen. \n",

If transferring from TFSA/RRSP, they would need to journaled to a Cash account (i.e., withdrawn-in-kind I guess is a good way of putting it) and then transferred to Computershare, so just be mindful of this.\n",

      "# Cliff Notes for Smooth Brains\n",

      "**TL;DR**: Tell RBC DI you want to initiate a transfer-in-kind using DTC transmission to Computershare for Direct Registrations of Shares (DRS). It should be completely managed by the RBC DI agent/backend. It costs $50 CAD and will take 4-6 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Details for the Wrinkle Brains\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok so first, the process I went through. I spoke with an RBC DI agent and requested a Direct Registration of my Shares (DRS) with Computershare (GME’s transfer agent). I was told that there would be a flat fee of $50 CAD (needs to be in the account prior to initiating the process). RBC would then snail mail the physical certificates to me, and then I would need to snail mail the certificates to Computershare. RBC said the turnaround time for this would be approximately 4-6 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I reached out to Computershare and spoke with a rep there asking about the process. They told me that I would need to request that my broker “initiate a transfer-in-kind using DTC transmission, it is transferring the shares from one financial institution to another.” Adding to this the agent stated, “Once the shares are moved to us, Computershare will create an account for you and will send you a statement containing your information such as your holder account number.” I then clarified to the agent that RBC told me they would send me physical shares and I would need to send them to the Computershare myself to be registered. The agent responded interestingly by saying, “Currently the certificate inventory is depleted. Please check again with another representative from RBC to initiate the transfer.” I found this odd so I asked the agent if that meant that RBC could not issue any physical certificates as they told me they would. The agent clarified that they were unable to confirm whether RBC could issue a certificate or not, but they added that “the process is mostly done electronically so a shareholder does not need to send us anything. But if RBC is suggesting to you to issue a certificate, you can send it to us so we can deposit the shares electronically and set an account for you at Computershare.” He then provided me with the address to mail it. I thanked him for his help and ended the chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I took this information and called RBC DI back. I got a different RBC rep this time, and she basically put me on hold as soon as I stated what I wanted to do using my newfound knowledge provided by the Computershare rep. She then came back on and transferred me to another agent who was clearly more knowledgeable in this. Immediately he asked me why I wanted to transfer to Computershare? He followed up by asking if I was worried about my shares being lent out. I assured him that wasn’t my concern (I had already asked RBC back when lending was the rage around here and they confirmed they don’t lend out shares in cash or registered accounts, i.e., they only do so in margin accounts). I told him I simply wanted to have my shares secured and held by the authorized transfer agent of the company. He then took me through the process: $50 CAD flat fee, 4-6 weeks turnaround, however this time he said the paperwork would be done completely on his end and they would submit the request. He clarified that the request was a “Digital DRS/DTC transmission.” He provided me with a “Request Confirmation Number” which he also called the “Case ID.” He said that once the request went through, Computershare would be reaching out to me to confirm the reception of the shares and, I surmise, to activate/open my account with them. The agent also confirmed that my original purchase dates and average cost would transfer over as well. I went ahead and initiated the transfer. Now I wait 4-6 weeks for the process to complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this helps some Canadian Apes who are with RBC DI and not sure of the process. I found it slightly confusing at first, but once I got someone knowledgeable and probably used the right wording, it was effortless. If you end up speaking with Martin at RBC DI, you’ll be in good hands.\n",

It took a month due to my fomo and finally decided to do it and was surprised it was so easy. These are based on my experience so please don't hate if it didn't go as smoothly for you.\n",

      "3. Decide whether you want a full transfer (all asset will be transferred) or partial transfer (if you want to retain partial assets in RH in case the MOASS happens during the transfer.)\n",

      "4. Initiate transfer of asset from Fidelity website or app. You can find the option in the transfer tab. (You will need your RH account number)\n",

      "\n",
      "6. Once RH receives the transfer request, your account will become restricted, and you will no longer be able to perform ANY transaction except looking at their well made interface. This typically lasts 1.5 business days.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Usually within 24-48 hours of initiating the transfer, you will see pending assets in your Fidelity asset transfer tracker. (Its better to track your status on their website than the app because it will show you more detail regarding the asset being transferred.)\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The transfer SHOULD complete within 48-72 hours if there are no hiccups, and any hiccup is probably due to RH releasing the asset.\n",

      "   * Old-school shilling just isn't working out anymore and so they've decided to instead go with a much more subtle approach. I'm sure I don't have to tell you about all the crazy distraction stock stuff that has been spread today. Notice how a VAST majority of the posts discussing this stock are actually calling it out. This is part of their new approach, to go with the grain rather then against it and just sprinkle little bits of FUD here and there in order to gain control of the narrative.\n",
      "      * Let's break down an example. Say for instance you see a post titled something like \"I got banned cause I called out WSB shills on their RKT pumping\". From a glance there isn't anything here that would invoke suspicion, after all we all know WSB is compromised and banning people. And we know that people have been pushing that distraction stock the entire day. However, you have to take a step back and approach it from a different perspective.\n",
      "      * Ask yourself this, if someone genuinely wanted to point out that rocket was obviously a distraction stock what would they do? Would they make another post in new about it after seeing the plethora of other posts already talking about it? Would they include the ticker for the very stock that is being used as a distraction in the title?  The answer is no, because ultimately these things all help rather then hurt the spreading of this new FUD. A distraction is successful when it gets you focusing on something other then what you were focusing on in the first place. If that is the case, if someone was REALLY concerned about this distraction stock, would they actively continue to talk about it and thus continue the distraction?\n",
      "      * We're going to have to start approaching posts in new with a lot more scrutiny. Look past the words being written and try to think about the message those words are sending. And know that we are not dealing with people acting in good faith. Nothing has changed with regards to the nature of the squeeze or GME. Be cautious of those that would suggest otherwise, approach their posts thinking about how they are trying to change your mind. If they are trying to change your mind by actually discussion holes in DD and basing their information on actual data then allow yourself to take their argument into consideration. Anything else, and they are most likely a shill.\n",

I've seen numerous, obvious shills that will use this argument as a means of establishing some sort of credibility to their ridiculous argument. These are actually really easy to deal with, and there are multiple ways to handle jokers like these.\n",
      "      * Remember to simply posts on the basis of what is being writing rather then the person writing it. If someone asks you to go through their post history to prove that their position is not coming from bad faith, it is likely because they are acting in bad faith. When someone gets called out for being a shill, if that person wasn't a shill the easiest way to respond would be to simply bring actual data or evidence to support their argument. If instead they talk past your argument and try to get you to go through their post it just shows further that they have no intention of refuting anything.\n",
      "      * Another thing to keep in mind is that post histories are easily curated and manipulated. If you are a frequent browser of new like myself, I'm sure you've seen the numerous memes and shitposts that get posted throughout the day. Think back to some of the lower effort ones you've seen, ones that really stood out like the poster had spent maybe 5 minutes on it. All of those low effort posts could easily be shills building up a history on the sub so that they can then turn around and use their post history as a way of giving their narratives credibility. NEVER take post history as a way of establishing credibility, it's gamed way too easily.\n",

Everyone and their mother says \"Look, shills hard at work downvoting LOL must be good DD!\", while there are a few things that make it look like that. One, reddit-side that's how it works, upvote count is wonky on purpose. Two, perhaps it's getting downvotes because it's not really that good. Ever thought of that?\n",

And with war comes casualties, the weakest fall (paper hands), and the strongest (Fellow Diamond Hands) pick up the fallen and bring them back to their families. We are holding not for the memes, and we are way beyond holding to get revenge for what the HF did last month. We are holding for our families, for our kids, for our children's children, for your wife's boyfriend. And everyday we hold we are one day closer to the promise land. We all come from different walks of life, whether we are betting our life savings on GME or we're throwing in half of our paycheck, whether you have 1 share or 1,000, we all want one thing: **To come out as the victor.** This war is not a one and done fight. There will be many battles each of us face, fear, greed and temptation. Buy your shares, put down your phone and stop worrying about what other people got in at and stop trying to beat their average cost. This is a war that must be fought without emotion. Look at the bigger picture and stop analyzing every minor battle that happens within. We each have our reasons as to why we entered this battle field. But we are APES 🐒🦧🦍and there are pesky humans with IQ's of over 9000 guarding our way out of this war, they are guarding our rocket and throwing every last munition at us in hopes of us not overthrowing them, but mark my words. The day will come when we end the barricade, when we board this rocket, and our kind will be on our way to **THE NEXT GALAXY.** we will remembered not as memers, not as braindead wastes of skin, or sweaty online trolls. But as the ones that got away. We may not have the firepower, but we have the numbers, and we pick up after each other if one of us is to fall. They control this hardpoint, we must take what is ours.

Yet you do not falter.\n",

You pull forward and one by one the hedgies fall and the 1000 bananas they owe are yours..\n",

In fact it is an endless rope full of bananas along the way. You pull and HOLD and pull and HOLD and you keep getting more and more bananas. 2000, 5000, 10000, 50000, it just keeps going and going.

What if I get more than couple of hundreds..what about couple of thousands..that would be nice. A couple of days passed and I'm like hey maybe I could get 50k, that would really help me with buying a new house. Then I was like you know what I want a whole house. Then another house for my mom. Then I wanted extra 300k for easier life. Now I want to be a millionaire and I'm not selling a single share before I get there.

This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aimé, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P.
